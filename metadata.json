  "long_description": "Description\n===========\n\n_[Hi, have a look at the blog post](http://devblog.springest.com/testing-big-infrastructure-changes-at-springest/)_\n\n__From the makers of [Gor](https://github.com/buger/gor):__\n\n> Gor is a simple http traffic replication tool written in Go. Its main goal is to replay traffic from production servers to staging and dev environments.\n>\n> Gor consists of 2 parts: listener and replay servers.\n>\n> The listener server catches http traffic from a given port in real-time and sends it to the replay server. The replay server forwards traffic to a given address.\n\n![chart](https://github-camo.global.ssl.fastly.net/556d4aa5db32de9535d84d6c6c07f6564b43fc0b/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f396d716a32534b2e706e67)\n\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nA Unix environment. Tested on Ubuntu, but any Linux, Unix, MacOS system should work.\n\n",
